## Typescript, ECM and CommonJS

Node modules `ts-node` and `typescript` provide compilation of Typescript to Javascript. Settings within `tsconfig.json` allow for ESM style Typescript (including linting) in the `/src` and `/tests` directories.

For compilation there are `tsconfig-cjs.json` and `tsconfig-esm.json` which are used to transpile identical source to CommonJS and ESM respectively into the `/build/cjs` and `/build/esm` directories with strict type checking.

The script `tsc` produces both ESM and the CommonJS output which is run by:

```cmd
> npm run tsc
```

Typescript declaration (*.d.ts) files are produced in both cases. For any other compilation options the tsconfig files can be modified accordingly.

## Test

To run Tests including Spell check and code coverage:

```
> npm test
```

Test is facilitated by the `chai` and `mocha` node modules. Tests are written as ESM, stored in the `/tests` directory with `*.spec.ts` filenames. There are sample tests on the file `/tests/test1.spec.ts`. 

There is a `mocha` script which just runs all tests:

```cmd
> npm run mocha
```

To view the html test output by opening it in a browser window:
```
> npm run mocha:view
```

If html output of test results is not required remove `html` from the `./.c8rc` file.

## Test Coverage

Test coverage is facilitated by the `c8` node module. The `.c8rc` file contains the settings for Coverage which is set up to produce lcov, html and inline text output into the `/coverage` directory. Coverage is run with testing by:

```cmd
> npm run mocha:cov
```

In this boilerplate the tests cover `add.ts` and `index.ts`, but not `subtract.ts`, giving a partial Coverage output.

## Coveralls.io

Coveralls is already set up and this provides a coverage report when commits are made to github. Coverage.io is free for public repositories. To set up Coverage on a new project created from this template:

    1 at [coveralls.io](http://coveralls.io), obtain a repo_token for your new repository and paste it into `/.coveralls.yml`
    2 in the /README.md file, change the link to the coveralls badge 

## Typescript Linting

Linting is provided by the `eslint` and `@shopify/eslint-plugin` node modules. The configuration is in the `./.eslintrc` file. To run the linter:

```
> npm run eslint
```

Some errors may be fixed with:
```
> npm run eslint:fix
```

## TSDoc

<!--- cspell:disable-next-line --->
TSDoc linting is provided by the `eslint-plugin-tsdoc` eslint plugin. The config in `./.eslintrc` is set to `warn` rather than `error`.

TSDoc will be run as put of eslint so TSDoc and Typescript linting are done together. 

## Spelling

Spell checking is provided by the `cspell` node module. The `.cspell.config.json` contains the settings for cspell.

The script to run spell check is:

```
> npm run spellcheck
```

A Visual Studio extensions recommendation for Code Spell CHecker is included which highlights spelling errors live in visual studio using the same system and configuration file.

# Development

During development it may not be desirable to meet all the linting and spelling requirements. In which case code can be just built (transpiled) using the `npm run tsc` script, and can be tested using the `npm run mocha` script, neither of which run the linter or spellcheck.

To see what will be published without actually publishing:
```
> npm publish --dry-run
```

To create a package locally:
```
> npm pack
```

Then install that in another npm package using:
```
> npm install path/to/my-package-1.0.0.tgz
```

## How to publish

1. Ensure `version` within `package.json` has been incremented
1. Check that a publish will be successful
    ```
    > npm publish --dry-run
    ```
1. Commit changes, push to github and create pull request
1. After committing to main branch in github, create a release with a name which matches the version number (ie. if version number is `1.0.0`, release name **MUST** be `v1.0.0`)
1. Check that the publish action has published the package from the release


# Visual Studio Extensions

The following recommendations are made:

- `Code Spell Checker` - see above section on Spelling
- `MyST-Markdown` - provides MyST syntax extensions for markdown in the markdown preview
<!--- cspell:disable-next-line --->
- `ryanluker.vscode-coverage-gutters` - provides live coverage info in the left gutter.
    - Command Palette `Coverage Gutters: Display Coverage` to start
    - Command Palette `Coverage Gutters: Watch` to watch for changes
<!--- cspell:disable-next-line --->
